# Legion

Legion is a tool that makes it simple to cross-compile CMake projects.

## Installation

Ensure you have the [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/) installed.

```bash
pub global activate -sgit https://github.com/IOT-DSA/legion.git
```

## Usage

```bash
cd path/to/cmake/project
legion generate linux-x64 linux-arm
legion build
```

For each target, a CMake build directory is created in `legion/${target}`.
